Improvement/Wonder Tips

As long as you’ve viewed your nation recently, you can get the financial impact of adding or removing an improvement or wonder just by mousing over it

Interface Modification

CNExtend provides the player the ability to filter and re-arrange their nation screen to suit their tastes. It allows the user to apply layouts or “profiles” which are immediately reflected on the page view. Profiles change the layout dynamically without refreshing or contacting the server after the page is loaded.

Each profile is represented as an XML file. Currently, these XML files have to be created or modified by hand, although that will probably change in the future. A few pre-made ones are provided as examples, but you can easily create your own. Each line in the file represents a row in your nation page.

The extension provides menus for switching between profiles or turning off profiles, either right click on the CNx icon, or just right click on your nation screen.

If you aren’t satisfied with the default layouts, you can make your own very easily!  CNExtend now includes its own layout editor.  To activate it, go to your nation screen and either right click on your nation view or right click on the CNX logo in the lower right hand corner.

You’ll see a floating window appear, which is your editor window.  Closing the window exits the editor.  You can left click and drag items from the window into your nation, drag rows within your nation view, or delete items in the nation view by clicking on the x button.  Finally, you can save by clicking the save button and choosing a name for your layout.  (There’s also an easter egg row hidden in the editor; more are coming soon!)

Everything is draggable; don't forget to save!
